BootStrap Personal page:
-this project was to learn and demostrate the use and power of bootstrap.
-honestly i ran out of time... I struggle a ton with is HW asignment and didn't have time to get the help i needed. Shame on me. I will be getting a tutor in the future.
-I did change how use the readme file and switch my single line comments from the readme file to the commit comments and attempted to commit often. 
-the hardest part for me was not using CSS... I got used to that and it was hard to switch to using the bootstrap class structure.. with more time I would get the hang of it.
-I only used one image on the portfolio page to get the structure and content reaction..
-I did choose to over write the prework about me page repo with this one as It will be my show piece going forward.
    + obviouly i need to do more work to actually call it a show peice.
-I ran all the files through a validator and fixed all the issues.
-well its 1130pm and i am going to do a final commit/push and see what the page looks like live and submit the urls.
- thanks,
